                <h2>Hardware Project <span>Automatic-Controlled Robot -: </span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is performed using C language. Components used in it are Arduino-UNO,Ultrasonic Sensor, DC motor,Motor shield L293D,Steper Motor,Voltage supply or batter(9V) and Chasis.
                    <li>That robot detects the obstacle and find the another way so that he can go through it. In it simple Principal is 
                        used as the Ultrasonic sensor transmits the wave which falls on the object and receives by the receiver in that 
                        way Robot sence and manage the it's motion and speed. It is safe from the collision with object. 
                </ul>
                <h2>Hardware Project <span>Line Follower Robot</span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>It is performed using C language. Components required in it are Arduino-UNO,IR sensor,DC motor, Motor shield L293D,Battery(9v) or Voltage Supply.
                    <li>The Robot detects the black line and only follows that black line. The simple Principal of IR sensor is used in it such as 
                        if the IR rays emit the light rays on the white surface it gets reflected but when it falls on the black surface it get 
                        absorbed by the black surface. 
                    </li>

                <h2>Software Project <span>Developed the Web application -: </span></h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Created the lot of web application using the Web Development(HTML,CSS,Javascript).
                    <li>I had created the lot of Big projects and this web page is example of that. I had created lot of web pages 
                        having the animation like continously background changing color of web page. When user hover on the box 
                        it will increase the height and width and lot of Greatful activity I had created. Such as showing the text 
                        as below example ;
